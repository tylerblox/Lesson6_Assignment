Questions:

1.  Name two methods you can use to add a node to the DOM tree, and explain the difference between them.

document.createElement()
and document.cloneChild()

are two methods that can be used.  Clone child would be used to clone a preexisting child so the code does not need to be re-written.  createElement() will create an entirely new child node.


2.  List the six main objects that make up the browser object model. 

window
document
navigator
screen
history
location
